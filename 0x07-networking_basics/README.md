# Networking Basics #0

This project covers the fundamental concepts of networking, focusing on the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, and the differences between TCP and UDP protocols. Additionally, it includes practical tasks related to network ports and checking network connectivity using the ping command.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the OSI model and its layers
- Differentiate between LAN, WAN, and the Internet
- Understand MAC and IP addresses and their purposes
- Describe the differences between TCP and UDP
- Recognize the common ports used for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
- Use basic network commands like `ping` and `netstat`

## Tasks

### 0. OSI Model
- **File:** `0-OSI_model`
- **Description:** Answer questions about the OSI model.

### 1. Types of Network
- **File:** `1-types_of_network`
- **Description:** Identify the correct network type for given scenarios.

### 2. MAC and IP Address
- **File:** `2-MAC_and_IP_address`
- **Description:** Define MAC and IP addresses and their purposes.

### 3. UDP and TCP
- **File:** `3-UDP_and_TCP`
- **Description:** Identify characteristics of TCP and UDP.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
- **File:** `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`
- **Description:** Write a Bash script to display listening ports.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network
- **File:** `5-is_the_host_on_the_network`
- **Description:** Write a Bash script to ping an IP address and handle arguments.

## Requirements

- All scripts should be executable and must pass `shellcheck` without errors.
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the first line of your Bash scripts.
- Include a comment explaining what the script does as the second line.
- Each Bash script should end with a new line.

## Usage

To run the scripts, make sure they are executable:

```sh
chmod +x script_name.sh
